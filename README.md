Detecting objects - Computer vision project

The main goal of this project is implementation algoritm, which converts a recorded image from camera to RGB filter. In this application I used algoritm Euclidean color filtering, which is part of external C# library AForge.NET. After conversion I implement blob filter, which allows rendering X,Y coordinates into component RichTextBox. Via the second RichTextBox algoritm render and writes the distance between two detected objects in units of length.
